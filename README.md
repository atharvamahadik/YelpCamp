View details about each campground (location, description, images)
Create a user account (authentication system)
Add new campgrounds
Leave reviews and ratings

Tech Stack Used: 
Frontend → HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (or Tailwind if updated), JavaScript, EJS templates, React (later updated version).
Backend → Node.js, Express.js
Database → MongoDB with Mongoose (for campground and review storage)
Authentication → Passport.js (login, signup, sessions)
Authorization → Users can only edit/delete what they own.
Cloud Hosting → Cloudinary for image uploads, Mapbox for maps, and deployment with Heroku/Render.

Why is it important?
It’s a real-world style project that mimics apps like Yelp/Airbnb.
Covers CRUD operations, RESTful routes, authentication, authorization, file uploads, security, and deployment.
